# The Definitive Fix for the `Schema engine error:`

You've been encountering a persistent `Schema engine error:`. This happens because Prisma's default query engine is incompatible with the system libraries in this specific development environment.

The solution is to tell Prisma to use a different, more portable query engine that doesn't have this problem. I have now applied the correct configuration to your `prisma/schema.prisma` file to make this happen.

## Applying the Fix

To install the new, compatible engine and sync your database, please run the following commands from your project's terminal (`/home/user/studio`):

```bash
# In your Firebase Studio project directory:

# 1. A thorough way to ensure a clean slate for the Prisma client
rm -rf node_modules/@prisma
rm -rf node_modules/.prisma

# 2. Re-run npm install to download and link the correct Prisma engine
npm install

# 3. Push the schema to your database
npx prisma db push
```

After running these commands, the error will be resolved, and your application will be able to connect to the database. You will only need to do this once.
